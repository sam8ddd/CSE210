Tasks are something that occupy a single time slot, and can be checked off. Repeating versions of tasks can be created.

Events occupy more than one time slot, meaning that multiple events and tasks cannot overlap. Repeated versions of events can be created.

Focus times don't "occupy" time slots, but rather distinguish a range of time slots as being devoted to a type of activity.
For example, you can mark a time as being devoted to homework, with multiple tasks and/or events within it.

Times are forced into steps of 15 minutes, using military time. For example, if you type 17:23, the time will be interpreted as 5:15 pm.
