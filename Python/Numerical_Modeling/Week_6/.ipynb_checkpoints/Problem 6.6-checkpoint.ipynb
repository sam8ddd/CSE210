    "# An important feature of a linear equation is that the sum of two solutions\n",
    "# is also a solution. One consequence of this is that two wavepackets will\n",
    "# travel indepentently of each other. An especially clear way to demonstrate\n",
    "# this is to set up a string with an initial profile such that there are two\n",
    "# Gaussian wavepackets, located at different places om the string. These\n",
    "# wavepackets (or components of them) may propogate toward each other and\n",
    "# collide. Show that the wavepackets are unaffected by these collisions. That\n",
    "# is, show that two such wavepackets pass through each other without changing\n",
